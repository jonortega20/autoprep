Introduction
============

This is an introduction to the library, providing an overview of its purpose and usage.

Autoprep provides tools for automating common data analysis tasks, including:

* **Data preprocessing and cleaning**: handling missing values, outliers, and data types
* **Missing value analysis**: identifying columns with missing values and their percentage
* **Outlier detection**: identifying outliers using z-score or IQR methods
* **Basic statistical analysis**: generating descriptive statistics for numerical columns
* **Model testing capabilities**: splitting data for modeling and testing

The library is designed to simplify the data preprocessing process, making it easier to prepare data for analysis and modeling.

While the goal is not to replace a manual human-led exploratory data analysis, it can help automate repetitive tasks and provide a starting point for further analysis.

Above all, some graphs could help to understand the data better and provide a starting point for further analysis made by the user.
